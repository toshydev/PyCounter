### PyCounter
#### A simple counter for weekly tasks.
---

PyCounter lets you add custom timers which let you know how many days have passed since the timer was reset.
It saves the date on which a timer was created or reset and compares this date to the current date.

Useful for remembering how many days passed since e.g. the last watering of houseplants etc..

##### Usage:
To add, set, delete a timer, or quit press "a", "s", "d", or "q" + ENTER respectively.

##### Counterfile:
The added timers are saved in a **counterfile.txt** which is created when quitting the program.
To remove all counters the **counterfile.txt** can simply be deleted.
